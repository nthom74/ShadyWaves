# Shady Waves

## Problem  
Living in Southern California, I face a tough decision every weekend—do I suffer through a feeling I hate so I can experience my favorite hobby with my friends?  

I love surfing, and the California coast is famous for its stunning beaches, great waves, and near-perfect weather. One of my favorite pastimes is floating in the ocean with friends—bobbing in the waves, drifting with the tide, and soaking in the salty air.  

But I *hate* the feeling of sunscreen! That oily, greasy layer suffocating my skin is almost enough to keep me indoors.  

Fortunately, sunscreen isn't always necessary. Meteorologists don’t just predict temperature and precipitation—they also measure a lesser-known factor called the UV index. It quantifies the amount of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface, factoring in atmospheric conditions and cloud cover to indicate how necessary sunscreen is at a given time and place.  

My paradise is a beach with perfect waves and a UV index so low that sunscreen can stay at home.  

This project is my quest to find that perfect spot.
